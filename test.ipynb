Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. (2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting the learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\n\\n### Scaling\\n\\nThere is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. While this work relied on a simple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff, Heafield et al. (2013) later showed how to scale Kneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This allowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions tokens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model with 500 billion n-grams (Buck et al., 2014). Chelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion Word benchmark, a large scale training dataset to measure the progress of language models.\\n\\nIn the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2021).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language models that are released openly, and competitive with state-of-the-art foundation models. Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. (2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to release larger models trained on larger pretraining corpora in the future, since we have seen a constant improvement in performance as we were scaling.',\n",

We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora of texts have shown their ability to perform new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\n\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of performance, a smaller one trained longer will ultimately be cheaper at inference.', metadata={'source': 'llama.pdf', 'page_no': 1}),\n",

I was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of sand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain of sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world. I longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon. One day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried out to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terrified that I would soon be swallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore, along with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to find that this new shore was even more beautiful than my old one. I soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life was constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a beautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring our little world. One day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the boundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things to see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go, but I wished him well on his journey. To my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made many new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe. He told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him. I often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some day, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\\n\\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed', metadata={'source': 'llama.pdf', 'page_no': 24})]"
